            I am dedicating this webpage to you, when I was younger I would 
            dedicate handmade cards to you along with handwritten letters
            for numerous occations. This Christmas, I thought it would be fitting
            that I make you a webpage as I am in a technology aligned program. 
            Mama, this Christmas most (if not all) my thanks are dedicated to you!
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you so much being understanding, loving, and caring everyday. Thank you for cooking
            delicious meals which comfort and encourage me to study hard.
            You are the best person I know, I look up to you and I will strive to learn from you
            as much as I possibly can. 
        </p>

        <p>I love you Mama! Merry Christmas! </p>
