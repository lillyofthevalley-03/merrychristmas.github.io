            My pretty sister, you have grown so well. Words cannot express how proud I am of
            your accomplishments. I love you so much, know that your dearest Ate is always here
            to listen to you. You are one of the people whom I consider precious to me, know that 
            I am ready to bash a person that you dislike and cheer you on during diffucult times.
        </p>

        <p> Your birthday is almost here, so your Ate is giving you present. I will give you exactly
            PHP 1500 as a gift, buy anything you want!
        </p>

        <p>I love you Pauh! Merry Christmas! </p>
